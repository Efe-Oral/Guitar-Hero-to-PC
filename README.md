# GH-drum-kit-to-PC
Hi in this project we will be turning our playstation ( or Xbox ) Guitar Hero drum kit to an electronic drum kit which we can control and play it with our PC.
I have tried quite few methods over time and some work for my PC's and some didn't. So i'll show you the latests version that worked for me.

**Step 1** Downloading FL Studio;
This is the DAW ( Digital Audio Workstation) we are goin to use. Download the program from this [link](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/) and set up in your PC.
